# COVID-19 Spread Simulator for Tracing App


This is a sub-project of [Peer-to-Peer AI Tracing App](https://mila.quebec/en/peer-to-peer-ai-tracing-of-covid-19/) delegated by [Prof. Yoshua Bengio](https://yoshuabengio.org/). Read more about the app in Prof. Bengio's [blog post](https://yoshuabengio.org/2020/03/23/peer-to-peer-ai-tracing-of-covid-19/).

The simulator is built using [`simpy`](!https://simpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/simpy_intro/index.html).
It simulates human mobility along with infectious disease (COVID) spreading in a city, where city has houses, grocery stores, parks, workplaces, and other non-essential establishments.

Human mobility simulation is based on Spatial-EPR model. More details on this model are [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms9166) and [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/nphys1760).

The infection spread in this simulator is modeled according to what is known about COVID-19.
The assumptions about the COVID-19 spread and mobility implemented in the simulator are in the [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jn8dOXgmVRX62Ux-jBSuReayATrzrd5XZS2LJuQ2hLs/edit?usp=sharing).
The same document also details our current understanding of COVID-19.
Our understanding is based on the published research as well as interactions with the epidemiologists.
We plan to update the simulator as more and more about COVID-19 will be known.


## Dependencies
Following `python` packages are required (python>=3.6)
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to run it using command line?
Run the simulator as -
```
python run.py sim --n_people 100 --n_stores 100 --n_parks 10 --n_misc 100 --init_percent_sick 0.01 --outfile data --seed 0
```

Output will be in `data.pkl`. It is a `list` of `dict`.


## How to run tests?
Run -
```
python run.py test
```

### Parameters

```
@click.option('--n_people', help='population of the city', type=int, default=100)
@click.option('--n_stores', help='number of grocery stores in the city', type=int, default=100)
@click.option('--n_parks', help='number of parks in the city', type=int, default=20)
@click.option('--n_misc', help='number of non-essential establishments in the city', type=int, default=100)
@click.option('--init_percent_sick', help='% of population initially sick', type=float, default=0.01)
@click.option('--simulation_days', help='number of days to run the simulation for', type=int, default=30)
@click.option('--outfile', help='filename of the output (file format: .pkl)', type=str, required=False)
@click.option('--print_progress', is_flag=True, help='print the evolution of days', default=False)
@click.option('--seed', help='seed for the process', type=int, default=0)
```

### Accessing Simulation Data
Load the output of the simulator as following
```
data = pickle.load(open("data.pkl", 'rb'))
```

## How to run it as a function?
Although not designed with this usage in mind one can still call it like this
```
from run import run_simu
monitors = run_simu(n_stores=100, n_parks=50, n_people=100, n_misc=100, init_percent_sick=0.01, print_progress=False, seed=0)
```

`data` is a `list` of `dict`.

## Base SEIR plots
Following will require `cufflinks` and `plotly`.
```
python run.py base --toy_human
```
It will open a browser window with the plot of [SEIR curves](https://www.idmod.org/docs/hiv/model-seir.html#seir-and-seirs-models).

## Semantics of code
`Human` class builds people, and `Location` class builds stores, parks, workplaces, households, and non-essential establishments.

## Semantics of Data
`data` is a `list`. Each entry in the `list` is an event represented as a `dict`.
The detailed information about events is in [docs/events.md](docs/events.md)
