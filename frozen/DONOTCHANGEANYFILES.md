Please do not change any code in these files unless you _really_ know what you're doing.
 
Any updates to these files must be manually copied to Nasim's codebase, otherwise things will break. Soon, we will have
this repo re-packaged to be pip installable. At that point, we can have Nasim's codebase import covid_p2p_simulation, and 
reference these files. Until that point, DO NOT TOUCH THESE FILES.
